# aleatorioJS
A website for chatting with random strangers on the internet. If it's online you can find it under the "About" section.

## How it's built up
The website uses a javascript `express` app backend and plain `js`, `html` and `css` for the frontend combined with `socket.io` websockets for the connections between users.<br>
On `<domain>/stats` you can also view the total number of users.
